Objective Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a UART loopback mechanism using the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board. The transmitted data through UART should immediately be received back, which will help verify the functionality of the UART system on the FPGA.

Steps Overview
The steps for this project are broken down into five major stages:

Study the Existing Code

Design Documentation

Implementation

Testing and Verification

Documentation

Step 1: Study the Existing Code
Access the UART Loopback Code:

The existing uart_loopback project can be found in the VSDSquadron_FM repository. Navigate to the GitHub repository to access the project files.

Link to the repository: VSDSquadron_FM Repository

Understand the Verilog Code:

Module Functionality: The main purpose of the module is to implement a UART interface where data transmitted on the UART TX line is immediately routed back to the RX line for testing. This ensures that data transmission and reception mechanisms are working properly.

Key Components:

UART Transmitter and Receiver: The UART module will take input data, transmit it through the TX pin, and loop it back to the RX pin.

FIFO Buffers: These buffers help temporarily store data to be transmitted and received.

Loopback Mechanism: This is implemented by connecting the TX and RX pins together in the FPGA code, creating a loop where the data transmitted on TX is instantly available on RX.

Step 2: Design Documentation
Block Diagram:

The block diagram should illustrate the following:

The FPGA acting as the controller.

The UART Transmitter and Receiver modules inside the FPGA.

The TX and RX pins are connected internally within the FPGA to create the loopback.

Optionally, any external peripherals (if used) such as a serial terminal interface or USB to UART converter.

Circuit Diagram:

The circuit diagram will show how the TX and RX pins are internally connected, either on the FPGA or to an external USB to UART converter if necessary.

For FPGA-based loopback, the TX pin will be routed back to the RX pin on the FPGA itself.

Ensure that the serial terminal or PC interface is also shown in the diagram for communication.

+------------------+               +-------------------+
Step 3: Implementation
Set up the Hardware:

Ensure that the FPGA board is properly connected to the computer using a USB cable, and any required peripheral devices (like a USB-to-UART adapter) are connected if applicable.

For the loopback, ensure the TX and RX pins are either internally routed on the FPGA or connected to an external UART interface.

If using external hardware, make sure that the TX from the FPGA is connected to the RX of the serial terminal, and vice versa.

Synthesize and Upload the Verilog Code:

Using the tools provided for the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini, synthesize and compile the Verilog design that implements the UART loopback logic.

Flash the compiled design to the FPGA.

Typically, you will use commands like:

bash
Copy
make clean
make build
sudo make flash
Ensure the FPGA is properly programmed and ready for UART communication.

Step 4: Testing and Verification
Use a Serial Terminal:

On your computer, use a serial terminal (such as PuTTY, Tera Term, or screen) to interact with the FPGA.

Configure the serial terminal to match the baud rate, data bits, parity, and stop bits that are set in the Verilog code (e.g., 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).

Send Data:

Send data from the serial terminal to the FPGA via the UART interface.

Observe the behavior of the FPGA and verify that the same data is returned to the serial terminal immediately after transmission, confirming the loopback mechanism works as expected.

Verify the Loopback:

The loopback is successful if the data you send from the terminal is echoed back in the terminal itself.

You may also add additional debug logic in the Verilog code to visualize the data at various stages in the FPGA.

Step 5: Documentation
Compile the Report:

Include the following in your final report:

Block Diagram: As described in Step 2.

Circuit Diagram: Showing the hardware setup.

Explanation of the Verilog Code: Describe how the UART loopback logic works, how the TX and RX pins are connected, and the use of FIFO buffers or other internal logic.

Testing Results: Document the steps you took to test the UART functionality, including screenshots or logs from the serial terminal showing data being echoed back.

Challenges Faced: If any challenges arose during the setup or testing, document them along with the solutions.

Video Demonstration:

Record a short video demonstrating the loopback functionality. In this video:

Send a sample data stream (e.g., "Hello World") from the terminal.

Confirm that the same data is immediately received back on the terminal, demonstrating successful loopback.
