Objective: Implement a UART transmitter that sends data based on sensor inputs, enabling the FPGA to communicate real-time sensor data to an external device.

1. Study the Existing Code:
Objective: Understand how sensor data is being acquired and transmitted through UART.

Access the Project: First, access the uart_tx_sense project within the VSDSquadron_FM repository. This project should already contain Verilog code for the UART transmitter and possibly a sensor interface.

Review the Verilog Code: Open the Verilog files in the repository. Pay close attention to:

The UART transmitter module: Look for a module that handles data transmission over UART. It will likely have a data input port (for sensor data) and a transmit enable control.

The Sensor interface: Find how the sensor is connected, whether it is directly providing data in parallel or serial format.

Clock management: Ensure the clock rates for sensor data acquisition and UART transmission are compatible.

Understanding the communication protocol used (e.g., baud rate, start/stop bits) will be essential for correct data transmission.

2. Design Documentation:
Objective: Create design diagrams to visually represent the integration of the sensor with the FPGA and UART transmitter.

Block Diagram: The block diagram should include the following components:

Sensor Module: Show the sensor’s data output (analog or digital).

FPGA: Illustrate the FPGA and the UART module.

UART Transmitter: Indicate how the sensor data is fed into the UART module.

External Device: Show the receiving device (e.g., a microcontroller or PC with serial terminal) and how it receives data via UART.

Circuit Diagram:

Connect the sensor (e.g., ADC or digital sensor) to the FPGA's input pins.

Ensure the UART Transmitter module inside the FPGA connects to the FPGA’s TX pin, which will transmit serial data to the external device.

Make sure there’s a level shifter if necessary (depending on voltage levels between the FPGA and the UART receiver).

3. Implementation:
Objective: Implement and set up the hardware and code for the system.

Hardware Setup:

Sensor Interface: Connect the sensor to the FPGA. If it's an analog sensor, you may need an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) to convert the sensor's output into a digital format.

FPGA UART Module: Ensure that the UART transmitter module inside the FPGA is properly connected to the TX pin for data transmission.

FPGA and External Device Communication: Verify the correct connection between the FPGA’s UART TX pin and the external device (e.g., USB-to-UART converter for a PC).

Code Integration:

The sensor data will likely be gathered through some form of polling or interrupt-based approach in Verilog.

Ensure that when the sensor data is read, it's fed into the UART transmitter module, which will serialize it and send it to the external device.

Synthesize and Load the Code:

Once the Verilog code is written and integrated with the sensor and UART modules, synthesize the design.

Use the FPGA development tools (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Intel Quartus) to load the synthesized design onto the FPGA.

4. Testing and Verification:
Objective: Ensure the system is working as intended by testing the sensor data transmission.

Stimulate the Sensor: Use a test stimulus to simulate the sensor's output (you can use test benches or real sensor data).

Observe Data Transmission:

Open a serial terminal (such as Tera Term or PuTTY) on your PC or external device.

Set the correct baud rate and other serial parameters to match the FPGA UART settings.

Verify that the transmitted data on the terminal matches the expected sensor data values.

Debugging:

If the data is not being received correctly, check the baud rate, stop bits, and other UART parameters.

Verify that the sensor data is correctly captured by the FPGA and passed to the UART transmitter module.

5. Documentation:
Objective: Document the design, implementation, and testing phases for review.

Assemble Block and Circuit Diagrams: Combine the block and circuit diagrams created earlier into a comprehensive section of the report.

Code Analysis: Provide a detailed analysis of the Verilog code used to interface the sensor and transmit data via UART. Include explanations of key modules and functions.

Testing Results: Document the results of the testing phase, including screenshots of the serial terminal showing the transmitted data, any troubleshooting steps taken, and any observations made during testing.

Short Video: Record a short video (2-3 minutes) demonstrating the system transmitting real-time sensor data via UART. This video should show the sensor being stimulated, the FPGA transmitting data, and the external device displaying the data on the terminal.

Suggested Tools & Resources:
Verilog Code Debugging Tools: Use simulators like ModelSim or Vivado Simulator for debugging your Verilog code.

FPGA Development Environment: Tools like Vivado (for Xilinx FPGAs) or Quartus (for Intel FPGAs) will be helpful for synthesizing and loading the design onto the FPGA.

Serial Terminal: Tera Term or PuTTY to observe the transmitted data.
