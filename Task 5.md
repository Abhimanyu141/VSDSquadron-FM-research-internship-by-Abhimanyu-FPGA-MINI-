Title:
Real-Time Sensor Data Acquisition and Transmission System

Theme Overview:
This project aims to design and implement a real-time data acquisition system using an FPGA platform. The system will interface with one or more sensors to collect environmental or physical data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure), process the data in real-time using FPGA logic, and transmit the processed data to an external system via a communication protocol such as UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter). This type of system has applications in embedded systems, IoT, industrial automation, and remote monitoring solutions.

Objectives
Conduct Literature Review:

Investigate existing FPGA-based sensor data acquisition and transmission systems.

Understand real-time constraints, communication protocols (e.g., UART), and sensor interfacing methods.

Study examples and applications of similar projects for benchmarking and inspiration.

Formulate a Project Proposal:

Define the overall functionality of the system.

List required hardware (e.g., sensors, FPGA board, power supply) and software tools (e.g., Verilog, simulation tools, terminal emulator).

Outline key implementation strategies such as modular design, test plans, and communication methods.

Development Steps
1. Literature Review:
Research FPGA-based sensor systems in academic journals, technical articles, GitHub repositories, and online tutorials.

Identify commonly used sensors and why they are chosen (e.g., DHT11 for temperature and humidity).

Understand data conversion and transmission challenges in FPGA systems.

2. Define System Requirements:
Hardware Requirements:

FPGA development board (e.g., VSD Squadron FPGA Mini)

Sensor(s) – temperature, humidity, or any analog/digital sensor

Power supply module

UART interface (RS232, USB-to-TTL converter)

Optional: Serial monitor for debugging

Software Requirements:

Verilog HDL

Simulation and synthesis tool (e.g., Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, Vivado)

Serial communication tool (e.g., Tera Term, PuTTY)

3. Design System Architecture:
Functional Blocks:

Sensor Interface Module: Reads raw sensor data.

Data Processing Unit: Converts and formats sensor data.

UART Transmission Module: Sends formatted data to an external system (e.g., PC).

Clock & Control Unit: Synchronizes data flow and operations.
