To develop a UART transmitter module for sending serial data from an FPGA to an external device, we can break the process down into clear steps, as outlined in your objective. Below is a more detailed guide based on your provided steps.

1. Study the Existing Code
Access the uart_tx project: First, ensure that you have access to the uart_tx project in the VSDSquadron_FM repository. Clone the repository to your local machine if needed.

Examine the Verilog Code: Look through the Verilog code to understand the following:

State Machine: Most UART implementations use a state machine. Understand how the state machine transitions between states (idle, start bit, data bits, stop bit).

Baud Rate: Check the baud rate generation logic to ensure the FPGA can transmit at the desired speed.

Shift Register: There will likely be a shift register used for serializing the data to be transmitted.

TX Pin: Investigate how the transmission pin (TX) is driven by the code.

2. Design Documentation
a. Block Diagram of the UART Transmitter Module
Create a block diagram showing the major components of the UART transmitter. These might include:

Data Input: A data source (e.g., a register or an external device sending data to the FPGA).

Baud Rate Generator: A component responsible for producing the correct timing to match the baud rate.

Shift Register: Serializes the data bits.

State Machine: Coordinates the flow of data and the timing of the start, data, and stop bits.

TX Pin: The FPGA's output pin that transmits the serialized data.

b. Circuit Diagram for FPGA UART TX Pin Connection
Create a simple circuit diagram to connect the FPGA's UART TX pin to the receiving device (e.g., PC, microcontroller, or another FPGA). Ensure you include:

The TX pin on the FPGA connected to the RX pin of the receiving device.

A ground connection between the FPGA and the external device.

Optionally, show the use of a voltage level shifter if the FPGA and the receiving device use different voltage levels (e.g., 3.3V vs. 5V).

3. Implementation
Assemble the Hardware Setup: Connect the FPGA to the external UART-compatible device, ensuring the TX pin from the FPGA is correctly wired to the RX pin of the receiving device (as shown in the circuit diagram).

Synthesize and Program the FPGA:

Use your FPGA development environment (e.g., Vivado for Xilinx or Quartus for Intel FPGAs) to synthesize the UART transmitter design.

Program the FPGA with the UART transmitter module. Make sure that the uart_tx module is instantiated and properly connected to the FPGA's I/O pins.

4. Testing and Verification
Connect to a PC or Another UART-Compatible Device: Connect the FPGA’s TX pin to the receiving UART device, such as a PC with a USB-to-UART converter, or another FPGA that receives the data.

Use a Serial Terminal:

On your PC, open a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term, or RealTerm).

Set the correct baud rate, data bits, parity, and stop bits to match the FPGA’s UART settings.

Observe the data being transmitted. The terminal should display the characters or data that the FPGA is sending.

Verify Data Transmission: Ensure that the data is transmitted correctly by comparing what was sent from the FPGA with what is displayed on the receiving device.

5. Documentation
Block Diagram: Include the block diagram created in step 2a.

Circuit Diagram: Include the circuit diagram showing the connection of the TX pin to the receiving device.

Code Walkthrough: Provide a walkthrough of the key sections of the Verilog code, especially the state machine, baud rate generation, and shift register.

Testing Outcomes: Document the results of the UART transmission test:

Baud rate settings.

Data transmitted and received.

Any observed issues and how they were resolved (e.g., incorrect baud rate or wiring issues).

Short Video: Record a short video showing the FPGA transmitting data to the receiving device and how it is observed in the serial terminal. Ensure the video demonstrates the accuracy of the transmission and the functionality of the UART module.

Tools and Resources:
FPGA Development Environment: Vivado, Quartus, or any relevant IDE for your FPGA.

Serial Terminal Software: PuTTY, Tera Term, or RealTerm for testing the UART communication.

Oscilloscope (Optional): For verifying the transmission signal waveform and timing.

This plan should guide you through the entire process of developing and testing the UART transmitter module on an FPGA.
