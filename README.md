Components Breakdown:
Data Input:

The source of the data to be transmitted. This could be a data register or an input from another device (e.g., UART receiver or microcontroller).

Shift Register:

A shift register is used to convert the parallel data into a serial stream for transmission. Each bit is shifted out one at a time, starting from the least significant bit (LSB).

Baud Rate Generator:

This component generates the clock signal for transmitting data at the required baud rate. The baud rate generator divides the system clock to match the desired transmission rate (e.g., 9600 bps, 115200 bps).

State Machine:

The state machine manages the sequence of events during transmission. It ensures that the data is transmitted in the correct order with start, data, and stop bits:

Start Bit: Signals the beginning of data transmission (low).

Data Bits: The actual data being sent.

Stop Bit: Signals the end of data transmission (high).

TX Pin:

This is the FPGAâ€™s output pin used for transmitting the serial data. The TX pin outputs the serialized data stream as per the state machineâ€™s timing.

      |  
   VCC (3.3V or 5V, depending on FPGA)
Key Connections:
TX Pin (FPGA):

This is the output pin from the FPGA that transmits data. It is connected to the RX pin of the external receiving device.

RX Pin (Receiver):

The receiving deviceâ€™s input pin, which will receive the serialized data sent from the FPGA.

Ground (GND):

A common ground connection is necessary to ensure both the FPGA and the receiving device operate with a shared reference voltage.

VCC:

The voltage supply (either 3.3V or 5V, depending on the FPGA and the receiving device). If the FPGA and the receiving device use different voltage levels, a level shifter may be needed to match the voltage levels of the TX and RX lines.

Design Considerations
1. Transmission Timing and Baud Rate
The baud rate must be correctly configured to match the transmission rate between the FPGA and the receiving device (e.g., 9600 bps, 115200 bps). The baud rate generator uses a clock divider to generate the necessary timing.

2. State Machine Design
The state machine ensures proper sequencing of the start bit, data bits, and stop bit. It needs to be robust and reliable to avoid transmission errors, such as misaligned data.

3. Shift Register for Serializing Data
The shift register converts parallel data into serial form for transmission. It works by shifting bits from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) before sending them over the TX pin.

4. Signal Integrity
Proper care should be taken in the design of the PCB or the wiring between the FPGA and the receiving device to avoid signal degradation or noise, especially at higher baud rates.

Conclusion
The UART transmitter module consists of key components: a data input, shift register, baud rate generator, state machine, and TX pin. The block and circuit diagrams provide a high-level understanding of the design and how the FPGA interfaces with the receiving device. This modular design ensures that data is transmitted reliably using the UART protocol, and the system is flexible enough to work with different external devices.
