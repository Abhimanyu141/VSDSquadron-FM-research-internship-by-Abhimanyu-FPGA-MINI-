UART Transmitter with Sensor Interface Documentation
1. Introduction
This project aims to design and implement a UART transmitter for transmitting real-time sensor data to an external device. The system is designed to interface with a sensor module and use the UART protocol to transmit sensor readings. The FPGA will acquire data from the sensor and send it serially via UART to a receiving device, such as a microcontroller or a computer.

2. Design Overview
The design involves integrating the sensor module with the FPGA and implementing a UART transmitter module within the FPGA. The system reads the sensor's data, processes it, and sends it serially via UART to an external device.

2.1. System Block Diagram
A block diagram is presented below that illustrates the interaction between the sensor, FPGA, and the external device.

Sensor Module: Provides data in either analog or digital format.

FPGA Module: Acquires sensor data and interfaces with the UART transmitter.

UART Transmitter: Converts sensor data into a serial format and transmits it via the FPGA's TX pin.

External Device: A serial terminal or any device capable of receiving UART data.

2.2. Circuit Diagram
The circuit diagram shows the connections between the FPGA, the sensor, and the receiving device.

The sensor output is connected to the FPGA's input pins (either analog or digital, depending on the sensor type).

The FPGA UART TX pin is connected to the UART receiving device (e.g., USB-to-UART converter to a PC).

If using an analog sensor, an ADC may be required to convert the analog signal to digital data before feeding it to the FPGA.

3. Implementation
3.1. Hardware Setup
The system includes:

Sensor Module: The sensor provides data which is either digital or requires ADC conversion.

FPGA Module: The FPGA processes sensor data and sends it through a UART transmitter module.

External Device: This device will receive the UART data and display it on a serial terminal.

3.2. Verilog Code Implementation
The Verilog code consists of the following modules:

Sensor Interface: Captures the sensor data.

UART Transmitter: Implements the UART protocol to transmit data serially.

Top-Level Module: Integrates both the sensor interface and the UART transmitter.

Sensor Interface Module
The sensor data is captured by the FPGA from the sensor interface (using ADC or digital read operations).

If the sensor data is analog, the FPGA will use an ADC to convert it to digital format.

UART Transmitter Module
The UART module takes the sensor data as input and serializes it.

It sends data bit by bit, starting with a start bit, followed by data bits, then a parity bit (if configured), and finally the stop bit(s).

The baud rate and other UART parameters (data bits, stop bits) are configurable.

3.3. Synthesis and Loading
The Verilog code is synthesized using an FPGA development environment such as Xilinx Vivado or Intel Quartus.

The synthesized design is loaded onto the FPGA.

The FPGA communicates with the sensor and transmits data through UART.

4. Testing and Verification
4.1. Testing Setup
Sensor Stimulus: The sensor will be stimulated to provide a known set of inputs.

Serial Terminal: A serial terminal (such as Tera Term or PuTTY) will be used on the receiving device to monitor the transmitted UART data.

FPGA UART: The UART TX output of the FPGA is connected to a USB-to-UART adapter that communicates with the PC.

4.2. Testing Steps
Stimulate the Sensor: Use a known input to the sensor, and observe if the sensor data is correctly transmitted.

Verify UART Data: Monitor the data on the serial terminal, checking that the data matches the expected sensor output.

Check Baud Rate and Parameters: Ensure the baud rate and other UART parameters match on both the FPGA and the serial terminal.

Debugging: If the data is incorrect or missing, check the signal integrity, wiring, and Verilog code for issues.

4.3. Results
The sensor data is transmitted correctly to the serial terminal, showing real-time sensor values on the external device.

5. Conclusion
The UART transmitter was successfully integrated with the sensor and FPGA. The system reads the sensor data, processes it, and transmits it to an external device using the UART protocol. The design was verified through testing, and the transmitted data was correctly received on the serial terminal.

6. Video Demonstration
