Project Proposal: Real-Time Sensor Data Acquisition and Transmission System Using FPGA
1. Introduction
In many embedded applications, real-time monitoring and control are critical. This project aims to design and implement a system using FPGA that can collect data from multiple sensors, process the data in real-time, and transmit it to external devices using UART communication. This will demonstrate the power of parallel processing and deterministic behavior of FPGAs in embedded sensor systems.
