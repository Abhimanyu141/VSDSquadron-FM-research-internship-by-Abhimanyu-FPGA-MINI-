🔧 Project Execution Steps
✅ 1. Develop FPGA Modules
Objective: Implement all functional blocks in Verilog (or VHDL).

Actions:

Design and code each of the following modules:

Sensor Interface Module – Communicates with the selected sensor(s) and captures data.

Data Processing Unit – Converts raw data into readable values, formats it if necessary.

UART Communication Module – Transmits data to an external device (e.g., computer terminal).

Clock/Timing Control Unit – Manages sampling rate and synchronization across modules.

🧪 2. Simulate and Test Modules
Objective: Ensure each module works correctly before hardware testing.

Actions:

Use a simulation tool (like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, or Vivado) to:

Simulate individual modules with testbenches.

Verify timing, output formats, and data transmission logic.

Debug and refine the code based on simulation results.

🧩 3. Integrate and Test Hardware
Objective: Combine all components and verify system operation in real-time.

Actions:

Connect hardware as per the system/circuit diagram:

FPGA board (e.g., VSD FPGA Mini)

Sensor(s)

Power supply

UART interface (USB-to-TTL, etc.)

Program the FPGA with the synthesized design using the FPGA toolchain.

Perform real-world testing:

Observe sensor behavior

Monitor UART output on a serial monitor (Tera Term, PuTTY, etc.)

Validate data accuracy and timing.

📝 4. Document the Project
Objective: Create clear, organized documentation.

Actions:

Compile a project report that includes:

System overview and objectives

Block diagrams and design schematics

Module-wise explanation with annotated code

Testing methodology and results

Troubleshooting insights and future improvements

Format for clarity (Markdown or PDF).

🎥 5. Create a Demonstration Video
Objective: Visually show your project working in real-time.

Actions:

Record a brief video (2–5 minutes) showing:

Overview of your setup

Sensor data being collected

Real-time UART output on a serial terminal

Narrate or caption key actions for clarity.

🌐 6. Publish on GitHub
Objective: Share your work with others and maintain a portfolio piece.

Actions:

Create/Use a GitHub repository for the project.

Upload the following:

All Verilog/VHDL source files

Simulation files and testbenches

Circuit diagrams and system architecture

Project documentation (README, report PDF)

Link or embed the demonstration video
