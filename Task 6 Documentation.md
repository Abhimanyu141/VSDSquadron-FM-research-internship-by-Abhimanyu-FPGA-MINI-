Project Documentation: Real-Time Sensor Data Acquisition and Transmission System

Execution Phase: System Development and Validation

1. Objectives

Execute the project plan by developing, testing, and validating the complete system.

Document the entire development process comprehensively.

Create a short demonstration video showing the project functionality.

Upload the complete project to GitHub.

2. Execution Steps

A. Develop FPGA Modules

Write Verilog code for all necessary modules:

Sensor Interface Module: Interfaces with sensors and reads data.

Data Processing Unit: Processes or formats the raw sensor data.

UART Communication Module: Transmits the data via UART protocol to an external system.

Clock/Control Logic: Handles synchronization and data timing.

B. Simulate and Test Modules

Use simulation tools like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, or Vivado to:

Create testbenches for each module.

Simulate and validate functionality.

Identify and fix any logic or timing issues.

C. Integrate and Test Hardware

Assemble the full hardware system based on the circuit diagram:

Connect sensors to FPGA input pins.

Link UART module to PC via USB-to-TTL interface.

Power the FPGA board.

Program the FPGA with the synthesized code.

Use a serial terminal (e.g., Tera Term, PuTTY) to monitor the UART output in real-time.

Validate end-to-end data acquisition and transmission.

D. Document the Project

Prepare detailed documentation including:

System overview and goals.

Design schematics and architecture diagrams.

Annotated Verilog code with explanations.

Testbench results and validation steps.

E. Create Demonstration Video

Record a 2‚Äì5 minute video demonstrating:

The hardware setup.

Live sensor data acquisition.

UART data output on the terminal.

Brief narration or captions explaining the system.

F. Publish on GitHub

Upload to your GitHub repository:

All Verilog source files and testbenches.

Circuit diagrams and documentation.

Video file or YouTube link.

A structured README explaining project purpose, usage, and contents.

3. Final Deliverables
